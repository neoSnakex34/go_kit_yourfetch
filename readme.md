## Wow a cat themed - catppuccin system fetch program, kinda original...
I know, right? But you know, sometimes you need to do things by yourself instead of relying on pre-written (probably better-written) utils.

## Does it work only with that ASCII art logo?
yup, but one can decide to scale the program in order to support taller ascii art.
Reading comments should be enough to figure it out how to. You can always open an issue tho!

## Does it support real images?
unfortunately not, i wrote it for alacritty that does not support real images visualization.

## Will it work on my distro?
it should, i tested it in some barebone containers, but i did not tested it on my others machines yet.
