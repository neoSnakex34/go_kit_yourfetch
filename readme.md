## Wow a cat fetch program, kinda original...
I know, right? But you know, sometimes you need to do things by yourself.

## Does it work only with that ASCII art logo?
yup, but one can decide to scale the program in order to support taller ascii art.
Reading comments should be enough to figure it out.

## Does it support real images?
unfortunately not, i wrote it for alacritty that does not support real images visualization.
